# Stone's Whisper

    Shall I compare thee to the ancient stone?
    Thou art more steadfast and more wise in ways.
    When battle drums beat loud and warriors groan,
    The gentle word outlives the sword always.
    
    Lo! In the quiet stream, the pebble learns
    To smooth its edges 'gainst life's harsh design.
    As twilight falls and day to evening turns,
    True valor blooms where peace and strength combine.
    
    What glory lies in conquest's empty throne?
    Far nobler hearts seek wisdom's quiet light.
    The mightiest oak from humble seed hath grown,
    As I, once fierce, now find my soul's delight.
