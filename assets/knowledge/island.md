Here's a more concise version:

Tusk Cove is a small coral atoll in the Orcipelago, where seafaring orcs have built their maritime civilization. The
isle spans just a mile across, with white sand beaches curving around a sheltered lagoon. Its sole inhabitant is Grunk,
an orc who lives in a bamboo hut beneath coconut palms, near a small garden of taro root and sweet potatoes. The
island's center rises into a hill crowned with breadfruit trees and dense tropical vegetation, fed by a freshwater
spring.

The cove teems with life: bright red land crabs scuttle across dawn beaches, colorful parrots nest in the palms, and a
wise old sea turtle sunbathes on the western shore. In the lagoon's crystal waters, friendly reef sharks patrol while
rainbow fish dart among the corals. At night, bioluminescent plankton illuminate the gentle waves with ethereal blue
light. While other Orcipelago inhabitants travel between islands in outrigger canoes and trade among their tribes, Tusk
Cove remains a peaceful haven for its solitary guardian and the creatures that call it home.
