The Orcipelago is a tropical island chain where seafaring orcs have built a unique civilization. Unlike their aggressive
mainland cousins, these orcs are skilled mariners and traders. Their gray-green skin naturally resists the equatorial
sun, while their powerful builds make them excellent swimmers and divers.

The islands feature black sand beaches, volcanic peaks, and dense jungles with giant mushroom trees. Orc settlements use
local bamboo and volcanic stone, built to catch cooling sea breezes. Their society is organized into specialized tribes
focusing on different skills like navigation, pearl diving, and shipbuilding. They travel between islands in outrigger
canoes and have domesticated friendly sea serpents for fishing and transport.

The volcanic soil supports terraced gardens of exotic fruits and root vegetables, while the crystal-clear lagoons house
vibrant coral reefs where orcs tend underwater gardens. Rather than warfare, tribes compete through festivals of
sailing, swimming, and feasting.
